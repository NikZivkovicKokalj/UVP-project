# UVP-project
Project for UVP course at Faculty of mathematics and physics at University of Ljubljana

I collected data from publicly available websites. The inflation data used in this project was obtained from the World bank website url: 
'https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG?end=2022&name_desc=false&start=2016'. The historical gold prices used in this project was sourced from url: 'https://www.macrotrends.net/1333/historical-gold-prices-100-year-chart'. Lastly, informations about US dollars printed through the years are available at url: 'https://www.federalreserve.gov/paymentsystems/coin_calprint.htm'. For gathering information I used packages: json, zipfile, pandas, os, requests, beautifulsoup and csv, while using: matplotlib and json for showing the results. Results of the project are in results.ipynb file. All the gathering of the informations are in files named after them.
